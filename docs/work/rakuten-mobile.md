# Rakuten Mobile

## Description

Rakuten Mobile is the world's first fully-virtualized mobile network operator, replacing the typical vendor black-box with virtual machines running on cloud compute.

When I started, our team was "VIP Assurance" (AKA Make sure the VIPs don't have problems). My manager wanted more for the team, and so he picked my resume out and added me to the team.
We started as a completely non-tech team, with no virtual machines, no compute-resources, no funding, nada. I did my job anyway.

I used my standard issue windows corporate laptop, python scripts that could read my outlook inbox using windows system APIs, and a dream to automate and scale our VIP assurance logic from less than 50 handsets to the full multi-million large network.
Within a quarter or two, our team was rewarded for our tenacity and as the sole engineer, I was promoted and given the opportunity to hire and manage my own team. 

For the next year and a half, we tackled problems faced by other departments that couldn't spare the resources to look into themselves. I was exposed to problems from grounded network live-update optimization problems (which I solved with graph-neural-nets), to more abstract concepts like measuring the actual "customer experience", rather than looking purely at traditional network KPIs.
