# Goody Goody

## Description

Goody Goody Liquor Inc is a local liquor retail chain to the Dallas Texas Area. During my undergraduate career, I worked summer internships here, before temporarily working as a Machine Learning Software Engineer.

As an intern, I worked on logistics-app development, store-location optimization, purchase-clustering for item placement optimization, and product-pair coupon creation.

Later, as a full employee, I oversaw the development of an AI-driven invoice parsing system, to automatically extract relevant fields from invoices to build an electronic database. Rather than the traditional approach to this problem, a reinforcement-learning Computer Vision model was created to extract image blocks from an invoice, which were then passed to a state of the art OCR library. This allowed us to have a system that could learn from use, and could accurately extract information from invoices the model hadn't been trained on. By creating a tool custom trained for our invoice formats, including those that were very long receipts, we were able to avoid paying large costs to record-digitization firms, and ended up with a system that could deal with the large volume of faxed and mailed invoices we received.
