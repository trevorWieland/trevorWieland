# About Me

As a Data Scientist at Virtusize, I work to bring machine learning power to fashion trends and provide best-in-class recommendations for users of Virtusize clients. I leverage my skills in natural language processing, time series forecasting, and deep learning to create modern solutions for a real product at scale. 

I graduated from Texas A&M University with a Bachelor's of Applied Mathematics at 19 years old, and moved to the opposite side of the planet to pursue exciting applications of AI. Before joining Virtusize, I led the development and research of ML projects in the domain of customer experience management at Rakuten Mobile, where I also acted as a Scrum Master and a developer advocate. I have a mix of both technical and management experience, and a zest for learning by doing. 

In my free time, I enjoy building AI projects that challenge me and inspire me, such as Pokemon-playing AI, game-translation tools, and MMO-market prediction models. I also contribute to open source projects, because I believe in the power of collaboration and sharing knowledge. I am passionate about solving real world problems with AI, and making a positive impact on people's lives.
