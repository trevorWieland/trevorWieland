# Virtusize

## Description

Virtusize is the leading fashion size-recommendation tool in the APAC area, striving to provide accurate fit recommendations from first-principles, rather than relying on "brand-to-brand" associations that fall apart when a brand is inconsistent.

I work to bring machine learning power to fashion trends in order to provide best in industry recommendations for users of Virtusize clients. Tying together Natural Language Processing, Time Series Forecasting, and Deep Learning to bring modern solutions to a real product at scale.

We run a tight-knit Data Science team at Virtusize, reporting directly to the CEO and working hand-in-hand with both Business and Operations teams to ensure that our recommendations and other products match client expectations.
